# Advent of Code 2020

This year I wanted to try out these exercises in Rust.  Last year I
did Go and the previous year was Python.  TBH, I had a lot more fun
with Python than Go, which I found pretty verbose (but faster).

It's been a goal of mine to start building some Rust muscle memory,
and nothing like an unpaid sabbatical and a bunch of exercises to make
it happen.
